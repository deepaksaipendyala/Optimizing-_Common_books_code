# Optimizing-_Common_books_code
## Exercise: Optimizing â€“ Common books
We provide the code your coworker wrote to find the common book IDs in books_published_last_two_years.txt and all_coding_books.txt to obtain a list of recent coding books. Can you optimize it?

Download the notebook file optimizing_code_common_books.ipynb and the text files. Open the notebook file using the Jupyter Notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete the exercise.

You can also take a look at the example notebook optimizing_code_common_books_example.ipynb to help you finish the exercise.
